Enhancing Product Review Analysis with Advanced NLP Techniques.
E-commerce platforms rely heavily on customer reviews
to inform potential buyers about product quality and
performance. However, the presence of fake reviews can
mislead customers and undermine trust in the platform.
Additionally, understanding the sentiment of genuine
reviews can provide valuable insights into customer
satisfaction and product performance. This project aims to
develop a robust system that can:
1. Perform Sentiment Analysis: Classify the sentiment
of product reviews (positive, negative) to provide an
overall sentiment score for products.
2. Detect Fake Reviews: Identify and filter out fake
reviews using advanced machine learning techniques
to ensure that only genuine customer feedback is
considered.
